                    <li><b>Advanced Microeconomics (8 ECTS):</b> First Micro theory course. The first half covered Consumer and Producer Choice theory, and in second we had Game theory. Professor Nicolas Schutz's made the course contents open to public. To see please check <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nicolasschutz/teaching">his webpage</a>. The course is titled as "E701 - Advanced Microeconomics I (PhD.).</li>

                    <li><b>Advanced Macroeconomics (8 ECTS):</b>
                     Roughly we covered neoclassical growth model (continuous and discrete time), overlapping generations (OLG) model, short review on Markov chains and recursive methods, heterogeneous agent models - in particular - idiosyncratic shocks and incomplete Insurance problems and complete markets model - in particular - Arrow-Debreu and Arrow securities. Finally we had a brief overview on asset pricing. See <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jgjq7ym52tsdy6u/phdmacro2014_I_syllabus_4.pdf?raw=true">outline</a> for more details.</li>

                    <li><b>Advanced Econometrics (8 ECTS):</b>
                    First Econometrics course in the PhD sequence. It started from measure theoretic definitions of probability and then gradually covered convergence concepts, conditional expectation, estimation and testing [see <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/93kkib1jn7v18uu/E703_outline_UniMannheim_2014.pdf?raw=true">outline</a>].</li>.

                    <b>Master Thesis:</b> <br />
                    Title: <i>Lasso & Vector Autoregressive Models - With Application to Dynamic Stochastic Networks</i>. 
                    <br />
                    Supervisor: Professor Carsten Jentsch, Chair of Statistics, Dept. of Economics at University of Mannheim.
                    <br />
                    Summary: My thesis was a combination of literature review about LASSO estimation (both for i.i.d. setup and VAR models) and applying it to a new setting. The novel section was looking at binary time series models with many variables together and fitting with LASSO. Then we showed how this model can have connections to dynamic stochastic networks. Using LASSO we estimated the probabilities of the networks. Previous work analyzed discrete time series models but not including many variables. Too many variables in VAR is computationally very demanding and model selection and other methods can be very difficult to implement. We took high dimensional approach of fitting the model using LASSO (Tibshirani, R. (1996). Regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso. J. Royal. Statist. Soc B., Vol. 58, No. 1, pages 267-288)). For fitting in particular, we used "Coordinate Descent" algorithm.
                    <br />

                    The dynamic network that we looked differs to what "dynamic" may mean in many network settings. In many dynamic networks the dynamics are meant to be how the nodes evolve over time. We looked at dynamics over edges. So at every time period, a particular edge between any pair of nodes are random and they may change over time. 
                    <p></p>
                    <br>

                    To have a rough idea about the dynamic networks that we are considering, have a look at the following network of 10 nodes (45 possible edges). Note how the edges appear and disappear. In principle, each network is realized at a particular time. It then shows how it changes over time. We created these series of networks with our own specified data generating process. In the thesis work, we estimated the probabilities (of this kind) of network formation.

                    I attended two other courses at the faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Heidelberg which are not part of my 121.5 ECTS (120 is the required) at the University of Mannheim.

                    I also give a very short overview of the courses that I attended during my bachelor studies.
                    <br />
                    <b>Economics:</b> In total I took 20 (16 required for major + 4 electives) courses from the Economics department, ranging from introductory to advanced level courses, notably 3 of microeconomics, 3 of macroeconomics, 2 courses on mathematical economics, 2 courses on econometrics and others related to different areas; e.g. international trade, public finance, environmental economics and economic growth

                     <br />

                    <b>Mathematics:</b> I took 4 mathematics courses from the department of Mathematics and Natural Science which were the following :Differential Calculus and Coordinate Geometry, Integral Calculus and Differential Equations, Linear Algebra and Multivariate Calculus and Real Analysis. None of these courses were required to complete the degree, but I took them to assist me in my journey at graduate school.
