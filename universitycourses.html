                    <b>Core Courses:</b> <br />
                    At my first semester I took four PhD level core courses.
                    
                    <ol>
                    <li>Mathematics for Economists (6 ECTS): Contents - Basic Analysis, Linear Algebra and Optimization theory [see <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1b06e1bwou5lmzn/MathForEconPhD_outline_UniMannheim_2014.pdf?raw=true">outline </a>for details]. Required textbook: De la Fuente, A. (2000). <i>Mathematical methods and models for economists.</i> Cambridge University Press.</li>

                    <li>Advanced Microeconomics (8 ECTS): First Micro theory course for PhD students. Professor Nicolas Schutz's made the course contents open to public. To see please check <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nicolasschutz/teaching">his webpage</a>. The course is named as "E701 - Advanced Microeconomics I (PhD.).</li>

                    <li>Advanced Macroeconomics (8 ECTS):
                    First macro theory course [see <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jgjq7ym52tsdy6u/phdmacro2014_I_syllabus_4.pdf?raw=true">outline]</a>.</li>

                    <li>Advanced Econometrics (8 ECTS):
                    First Econometrics course in the PhD sequence. It started from measure theoretic definitions of probability and then gradually covered convergence concepts, conditional expectation, estimation and testing [see <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/93kkib1jn7v18uu/E703_outline_UniMannheim_2014.pdf?raw=true">outline]</a></li>.

                    <br />
                    </ol>



                    <b>Specialization Courses:</b> <br />
                    At my specialization phase I mostly took courses offered at the chair of Statistics and Econometrics. 

                    <p></p>
                    <ol>

                    <li>Financial Time Series (5 ECTS): 
                    It was a seminar course on theoretical times series. Seminar topics include different properties of ARCH and GARCH models, Threshold AR models, Bilinear models and Random coefficient AR models [<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0r4ie006fbusshp/Seminar_financial_time_series_slides.pdf?raw=true">outline]</a>.</li>

                    <li>Empirical Environmental Economics (5 ECTS): 
                    This seminar covered recent empirical research in Environmental Economics, in particular on air pollution control. Here is the outline. </li>

                    <li>High-Dimensional Covariance Estimation (5 ECTS): 
                    Initially the plan of this seminar was to offer contents from high-dimensional covariance estimation. But because  many of us were interested  in high dimensional statistics, later this course had topics from both from High Dimensional Statistics and High Dimensional Covariance estimation. [outline]</li>     
                                                    
                    <li>Fundamentals of Machine Learning (8 ECTS): 
                    In Mannheim I had an excellent opportunity to take courses from Mathematics and Computer science department. Also as a Mannheim student, I could take courses from the University of Heidelberg. I took this opportunity and attended different courses offered from the faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Heidelberg. Unfortunately,  due to credit constraints of outside department courses, I could not take all courses as credit courses. Machine Learning was one of the very first course I attended (I mentioned other courses later, because they are not part of the required credits). It was an amazing course for me . I learned a completely new way of  looking  at statistical problems. Also I was introduced to many new methods. Professor Ulrich Koethe created a webpage for the course, I think its still available, please click here to go to the page.                       
                    </li>
                    <li>Impact Evaluation, Treatment Effects, Causal Analysis (5 ECTS): 
                    The course covered some recent methods of applied microeconometrics; eg. RCTs, matching, IV estimation, DID and RDD. [outline]</li>  

                    <li>Advanced Time Series Analysis (9 ECTS): 
                    It was a PhD level theory course on time series analysis. I give the outline and comments on reading. The outline is very brief  and doesn't tell much about what we covered. Please look at the comments on reading for more details.</li>

                    <li>Microeconometric Methods: Duration, Count Data, and Censored Regression Analysis (9 ECTS): 
                    We covered topics from duration and hazard models,  sampling schemes, censoring, maximum likelihood estimation of duration models, unobserved heterogeneity, multiple durations (panel data), treatment analysis, count data models, censored regression models, sample selection. [outline]</li>

                    <li>Advanced Microeconometrics (9.5 ECTS): 
                    The course covered fundamental methods for microeconomic data, including maximum likelihood, GMM, quantile regression, the bootstrap and Bayesian methods. [outline]</li>

                    <li>Dynamic Stochastic Networks (5 ECTS): 
                    The seminar covered topics from Network theory. Please see the outline.</li>

                    <b>Economics:</b> In total I took 20 (16 required for major + 4 electives) courses from the Economics department, ranging from introductory to advanced level courses, notably 3 of microeconomics, 3 of macroeconomics, 2 courses on mathematical economics, 2 courses on econometrics and others related to different areas; e.g. international trade, public finance, environmental economics and economic growth

                     <br />

                    <b>Mathematics:</b> I took 4 mathematics courses from the department of Mathematics and Natural Science which were the following :Differential Calculus and Coordinate Geometry, Integral Calculus and Differential Equations, Linear Algebra and Multivariate Calculus and Real Analysis. None of these courses were required to complete the degree, but I took them to assist me in my journey at graduate school.
